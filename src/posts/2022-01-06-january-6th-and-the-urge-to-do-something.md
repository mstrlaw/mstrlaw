title: January 6th And The Urge To Do Something
summary: Today marks the one year anniversary of the storming of the U.S.
  Capitol. I'm not American but I believe in the democratic system and, at that
  moment, I felt the urge to do something.

In the dullness of the end of a regular day at the office, my colleague Mathieu turns and casually announces "Looks like people are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack" target="_blank">attacking the U.S. Capitol building</a>".

\- "Attacking? You mean terrorist attacks?"

\- "No like, Americans. Trump supporters it seems."

We looked at the feeds on Twitter, live streaming CNN or Fox on Youtube and checking the headlines here and there.

Now, Lisbon is far away from Washington D.C. which means that it isn't our Capitol, it wasn't a Portuguese building. That crowd wasn't attacking the Parliament. 

But in a very concrete way, it attacked something that we share with Americans: the ideal of Democracy. And that was, indeed, something dystopian to watch live.
