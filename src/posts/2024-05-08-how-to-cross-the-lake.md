S﻿ome time ago I went for some climbing with a friend. We camped, climbed some peaks and overall had a blast.

O﻿n the last day, we made sure to return to base camp early enough as we knew there was some risk of hail for the end of the day.

The local hut was closed but lucky for us, they had a section accessibly for mountaineers to use in case of need (mountain huts usually have one of these: a place people can get shelter and even spend the night should they need to).

A﻿s we spend the early evening, him and I spoke while warming ourselves by drinking tea and looking out through a little window at the hail falling down on the frozen, with the mountains as the backdrop.

A﻿t some point he asked "So what is that you do in this new job of yours? What is that an Engineering Manager does?"
