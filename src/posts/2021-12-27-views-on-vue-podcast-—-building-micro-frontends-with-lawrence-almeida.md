A conversation on the <a href="https://viewsonvue.com/building-micro-frontends-with-lawrence-almeida-vue-160" target="_blank">Views on Vue</a> podcast with <a href="https://twitter.com/lindsaykwardell" target="_blank">Lindsay Wardell</a> where we discussed basic issues with micro frontends, and how they can be resolved with Single SPA, a framework for orchestrating micro frontends. 

We also discussed why a team would choose this approach, and some of the downsides to adopting micro frontends.
