Sat down with <a href="https://twitter.com/lindsaykwardell" target="_blank">Lindsay Wardell</a> to discuss basic issues with micro frontends, and how they can be resolved with Single SPA, a framework for orchestrating micro frontends. 

We also discuss why a team would choose this approach, and some of the downsides to adopting micro frontends.
