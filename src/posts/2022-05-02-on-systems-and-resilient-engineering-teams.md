title: On Systems and Resilient Engineering Teams
summary: >-
  Product oriented companies usually go through quick cycles of iterations, each
  bringing answers but also new questions. This happens on both operational
  teams — conceptualizing and building the product — as well as executive teams
  — strategizing and defining the product high-level direction.


  Individuals operate on a spectrum of assumptions, known unknowns and unknown unknowns. 


  And that’s fine. That’s the reality when building novel products and services : you’re making bets on educated guesses and you’re betting time and money on those guesses.

So what about resiliency? Given this context, resiliency is the ability to cope with constant change and navigate it effectively. From Merriam-Webster: “ability to recover from or adjust easily to adversity or change”. Adjusting and recovering.

A fair amount of people don’t like change. In my experience, Developers and designers don’t enjoy hopping rapidly between missions. But for when that happens, team leaders must help teams become resilient. And to build a resilient team requires acting and caring on an individual level.
