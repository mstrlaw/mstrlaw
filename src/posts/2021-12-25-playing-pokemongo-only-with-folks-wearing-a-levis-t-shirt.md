title: Playing PokemonGo, only with folks wearing a Levis t-shirt
summary: If you happen to stroll around Lisbon, Porto or Algarve around some
  crowded areas like shopping malls, there are moments where, at any given
  moment, youâ€™ll literally have a Levis shirt in any of your eyesight's angle.
  Thereâ€™s no escaping it!

All aboard the Levis shirt train!

So, what if we had an app that recognized a Levis t-shirt and, each time you saw one, youâ€™d could take a photo like PokemonGo and earn some points?

We could call it *Levimon* (get it? ðŸ™Š)

## Specs

1. Should be able to take photo with a phone
2. Should be able to identify whether or not the person is wearing a Levis shirt
3. Reward points to the player

<hr>

Initially, my idea was to use theÂ [](https://trackingjs.com/)<a href="https://trackingjs.com/" target="_blank">tracking.js</a>Â library toÂ [](https://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html)<a href="https://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html" target="_blank">track the red from the t-shirt</a>, then isolate it in a square with a standard size using image manipulation libraryÂ [](http://fabricjs.com/)<a href="http://fabricjs.com/" target="_blank">fabric.js</a>.

Weâ€™d then useÂ [](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/)<a href="http://caza.la/synaptic/#/" target="_blank">synaptic.js</a>Â to build a Neural Network that could identify the brand.

In other words,Â **a ton of work!** 

First, youâ€™d need to handle standardizing the photo to extract the brand area. Moreover and as importantly, youâ€™d need to create a good training data set for the NN to identify the t-shirt.

Thatâ€™s too much for an afternoon project! Plus, there are some variations of it with blue shirts instead of white; some others look like a Pepsi logo. So, interesting challenge, but probably crappy solution.

Hold on, how â€˜bout usingÂ [](https://clarifai.com/)<a href="https://clarifai.com/" target="_blank">Clarifai</a>? Those guys have some solid computer vision solutions, includingÂ [](https://clarifai.com/models/logo-image-recognition-model-c443119bf2ed4da98487520d01a0b1e3)<a href="https://clarifai.com/models/logo-image-recognition-model-c443119bf2ed4da98487520d01a0b1e3" target="_blank">identifying brands</a>. On top of that, they have a free tier providing 5k transactions/month, ideal for our test case. Bingo!

## *Actually* building theÂ app

The app itself is a standard VueJS app created usingÂ *vue-cli.*Â The whole code can be found onÂ [](https://github.com/mstrlaw/levimon)<a href="https://github.com/mstrlaw/levimon" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Below are some of the interesting code nuggets.

<hr>

**Accessing the deviceâ€™sÂ camera**

We do that by using theÂ *accept*Â andÂ *capture*Â parameters on a regular input element, such as:

<code>

<input id="cameraInput" type="file" name="camera" accept="image/*" class="image-input" capture @change="processImage($event)">

</code>

**Reading the image & passing it toÂ Clarifai**

The Shutter component simply passes the whole event on input change.Â App.vueÂ handles the rest. We call theÂ identifyBrandÂ method whenÂ imageDataÂ event is triggered. 

Then, to read the content of the image we employ the FileReader API and use theÂ *onload*Â callback to then feed the data back to Clarifai, such as:

<code>

<pre>
...
methods:{
  identifyBrand(imageData){
    this.hasMatch = null
    let foundBrand = false
    reader.onload = (e) => {
      //  We only want to pass the Base64 encoded string to Clatifai
      let img = e.target.result.replace(/^data:image\/\[a-z]+;base64,/, '')
      clarifai.models
      //  Use the right model to identify brands and pass the image as base64
      .predict(process.env.VUE_APP_PREDICT_MODEL, { base64: img })
      .then((r) => {
        if (r.status.code === 10000) {
          if (r.outputs.length > 0) {
            //  Check if Clarifai has returned any matches
            if (Object.keys(r.outputs\[0].data).length > 0) {
              //  Clarifai returns the multiple places with matches in the image
              r.outputs\[0].data.regions.map( el => {
                //  Bulletproof. Just looking for 'levi' match in the name value
                if (el.data.concepts\[0].name.toLowerCase().match('levi') !== null) {
                  //  Only count the match if the confidence score is above .9
                  if (el.data.concepts\[0].value >= 0.9) {
                    foundBrand = true
                  }
                }
              })
              //  If there's a match, change this value to then display a success/error dialog
              if (foundBrand) {
                this.hasMatch = true
              } else {
                this.hasMatch = false
              }
            } else {
              this.hasMatch = false
            }
          }
        }
      },
      (err) => {
        alert(err)
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.log(err)
      })
    }
    // Load imageData  
    reader.readAsDataURL(imageData)
  },
  ...

</pre>

## Testing it

![A couple posing for a picture, wearing a Levis shirt.](/static/images/levis_shirt.png "Photo byÂ Bruno VazÂ for the amusingÂ NIT articleÂ on people wearing Levis t-shirts.")

<p class="u-ImageDescription">Photo byÂ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/godinhovaz/" target="_blank">Bruno Vaz</a>Â for the amusingÂ <a href="https://www.nit.pt/compras/lojas-e-marcas/porque-e-que-toda-a-gente-no-rock-in-rio-usa-as-mesmas-t-shirts-da-levis" target="_blank">NIT article</a>Â on people wearing Levis t-shirts.</p>

## In The Wild

After walking for 1h, I spottedÂ *at least*Â 20 people wearing it! ðŸ™ˆ

Most of them were too far or it was just to awkward to snap a picture hence a lot of missed opportunities.

Regarding the accuracy of Clarifai, unfortunately most of the times it wouldnâ€™t get a match, even on very up-front & close pictures (Lightning conditions? Angle? Ripples in the shirtâ€™s fabric?) so never mind my score..

Keep in mind though that this demo only keeps track of the score using Vuex, so no persistent storage. If time permits, I may have some fun in the future plugin in Firebase, just for the kicks of it.

Besides storing to a DB, some other nice-to-haves would be:

* Streaming the camera image/video directly to Clarifai and have it more real-time;
* Blur peopleâ€™s faces automatically using tracking.js;
* Adding some geolocation data to it?;

<hr>

And there you go! A very rudimentary way of having some fun-with-friends: "*Hey, who can spot the most Levimons out there?â€Šâ€”â€ŠAh thereâ€™s a ton of â€™em here!*"
