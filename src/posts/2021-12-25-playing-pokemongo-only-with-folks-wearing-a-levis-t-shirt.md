title: Playing PokemonGo, only with folks wearing a Levis t-shirt
summary: If you happen to stroll around Lisbon, Porto or Algarve around some
  crowded areas like shopping malls, there are moments where, at any given
  moment, youâ€™ll literally have a Levis shirt in any of your eyesight's angle.
  Thereâ€™s no escaping it!

All aboard the Levis shirt train!

So, what if we had an app that recognized a Levis t-shirt and, each time you saw one, youâ€™d could take a photo like PokemonGo and earn some points?

We could call it *Levimon* (get it? ðŸ™Š)

## Specs

1. Should be able to take photo with a phone
2. Should be able to identify whether or not the person is wearing a Levis shirt
3. Reward points to the player

Initially, my idea was to use theÂ [](https://trackingjs.com/)<a href="https://trackingjs.com/" target="_blank">tracking.js</a>Â library toÂ [](https://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html)<a href="https://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html" target="_blank">track the red from the t-shirt</a>, then isolate it in a square with a standard size using image manipulation libraryÂ [](http://fabricjs.com/)<a href="http://fabricjs.com/" target="_blank">fabric.js</a>.

Weâ€™d then useÂ [](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/)<a href="http://caza.la/synaptic/#/" target="_blank">synaptic.js</a>Â to build a Neural Network that could identify the brand.

In other words,Â **a ton of work!** 

First, youâ€™d need to handle standardizing the photo to extract the brand area. Moreover and as importantly, youâ€™d need to create a good training data set for the NN to identify the t-shirt.
