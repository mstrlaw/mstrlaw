title: Playing PokemonGo, only with folks wearing a Levis t-shirt
summary: If you happen to stroll around Lisbon, Porto or Algarve around some
  crowded areas like shopping malls, there are moments where, at any given
  moment, youâ€™ll literally have a Levis shirt in any of your eyesight's angle.
  Thereâ€™s no escaping it!

All aboard the Levis shirt train!

So, what if we had an app that recognized a Levis t-shirt and, each time you saw one, youâ€™d could take a photo like PokemonGo and earn some points?

We could call it *Levimon* (get it? ðŸ™Š)

## Specs

1. Should be able to take photo with a phone
2. Should be able to identify whether or not the person is wearing a Levis shirt
3. Reward points to the player

Initially, my idea was to use theÂ [](https://trackingjs.com/)<a href="https://trackingjs.com/" target="_blank">tracking.js</a>Â library toÂ [](https://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html)<a href="https://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html" target="_blank">track the red from the t-shirt</a>, then isolate it in a square with a standard size using image manipulation libraryÂ [](http://fabricjs.com/)<a href="http://fabricjs.com/" target="_blank">fabric.js</a>.

Weâ€™d then useÂ [](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/)<a href="http://caza.la/synaptic/#/" target="_blank">synaptic.js</a>Â to build a Neural Network that could identify the brand.

In other words,Â **a ton of work!** 

First, youâ€™d need to handle standardizing the photo to extract the brand area. Moreover and as importantly, youâ€™d need to create a good training data set for the NN to identify the t-shirt.

Thatâ€™s too much for an afternoon project! Plus, there are some variations of it with blue shirts instead of white; some others look like a Pepsi logo. So, interesting challenge, but probably crappy solution.

Hold on, how â€˜bout usingÂ [](https://clarifai.com/)<a href="https://clarifai.com/" target="_blank">Clarifai</a>? Those guys have some solid computer vision solutions, includingÂ [](https://clarifai.com/models/logo-image-recognition-model-c443119bf2ed4da98487520d01a0b1e3)<a href="https://clarifai.com/models/logo-image-recognition-model-c443119bf2ed4da98487520d01a0b1e3" target="_blank">identifying brands</a>. On top of that, they have a free tier providing 5k transactions/month, ideal for our test case. Bingo!

## *Actually* building theÂ app

The app itself is a standard VueJS app created usingÂ *vue-cli.*Â The whole code can be found onÂ [](https://github.com/mstrlaw/levimon)<a href="https://github.com/mstrlaw/levimon" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Below are some of the interesting code nuggets.

**Accessing the deviceâ€™sÂ camera**

We do that by using theÂ *accept*Â andÂ *capture*Â parameters on a regular input element, such as:

<code>

// Within Shutter.vue component

<input id="cameraInput" type="file" name="camera" accept="image/*" class="image-input" capture @change="processImage($event)">

</code>
