For this massive release, the teams had been working intensely for consecutive sprints to meet an important milestone for the business. There was no way around this date but we had managed to negotiate the details of what was to be delivered. Regardless, it was a lot.

Things didn't run smoothly nor equally for many of the team members. Delivery hadn't been thoroughly planned nor accompanied, cross-team dependencies hadn't been mapped or coordinated in detail. Much planning detail was left out as people were subject to a lot of context switch from different cognitive domains.

There's more to this. To me it's a good example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model" target="_blank">Swiss Cheese Model</a> in action.

As we moved closer to the release date, I noticed that communication was picking up in various Slack channels between team members within and out of their respective teams. Some of it was on aligning expectation to get some dependencies delivered yet much of it was clarification on specificities of what they were delivering.

It was kind of wild seeing the (sometimes recurring) questions, doubts and confusion picking up pace as teams were merging their work together or getting feedback from various stakeholders as they deployed their work.

Reading the below line from the book's 2nd chapter made me wonder: can communication frequency and volume be a health proxy when it comes to delivery success?

> Fast flow requires restricting communication between teams. Team collaboration is important for gray areas of development, where discovery and expertise is needed to make progress. But in areas where execution prevails – not discovery – communication becomes an unnecessary overhead.
