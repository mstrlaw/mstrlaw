It's that time to refactor my website. Again.

I don't know how ofter others think about changing their websites. I wonder how often they actually end up doing so. I guess it depends on the sort of developer we're talking about..

In the past, I've used my website as a business card (in a way I still do). But I've also used it as a place to test and learn new things.

## The quest to zero

Lately I've been wanting to make it more performant, closer to an old school vanilla website without any fancy frontend framework. Less CSS, less JS, less bloat. Less is more, right?

After all, what's a dev's website if not a reflection of what they value?

It's also a way of embodying minimalism, not only on a look perspective but as a whole, meaning a simpler stack too. Isn't it funny to think that a website should evolve as its owner does so too?

Anyways I've decided to moved my website from <a href="https://gridsome.org/" target="_blank">Gridsome</a> to an even more bare bones <a href="https://www.metalsmith.io/" target="_blank">Metalsmith</a>.
