It's that time to refactor my website, again.

I don't know how ofter others think about changing their websites. I wonder how often they actually do. I guess it depends on the sort of developer we're talking about.

In the past I've used my website as a business card (in a way I still do). But I've also used it as a place to test and learn new things.

## The quest to zero

Lately I've been wanting to really make it more bare bones. Less CSS, less JS, less bloat. Faster performance. After all, what's a dev's website if not a reflection of what they value?

I've moved my website from <a href="https://gridsome.org/" target="_blank">Gridsome</a> to <a href="https://www.metalsmith.io/" target="_blank">Metalsmith</a>
