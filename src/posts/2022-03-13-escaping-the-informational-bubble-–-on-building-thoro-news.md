title: Escaping the Informational Bubble – on Building Thoro News
summary: As <a href="https://thoro.news" target="_blank">Thoro News</a> reaches
  almost 10MM articles in its database and 2MM clustered topics, I take the time
  to reflect on the <em>raison d'être</em> of this personal project that started
  in 2019.

<p class="u-ImageDescription">Thoro News in 2019.</p>

<br>

I'm a strong believer that the best way to generate a more accurate view of the world is by feeding our minds with a broad and diverse set of information.

<b>Truth lies somewhere in the middle.</b>

We don't control the mental mechanism that shapes our opinions, thoughts and beliefs but we can determine which information we feed our minds.

<h2>Dealing With Other's News Feeds</h2>

It all started around 2017 when I optimized my Facebook news feed to only display posts from news pages. I was following perhaps less than 50 news sources and, for a while, it was ok.

The first problem I noticed was that I was only seeing a subset of news published by the page. If I entered the page, I'd see there were many more posts published on any given day, but Facebook's algorithm had decided that only a couple of posts would get put on my wall. So essentially I had no control over which posts were being shown as well as no understanding to why one post was shown over the other.

The second problem was that, at any point, Facebook could and would change the way its algorithmic feed operated. In 2018, Facebook <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/01/11/facebook-focuses-news-feed-on-friends-and-family-curbing-the-reach-of-brands-and-media/" target="_blank">decided it would prioritize posts mad by friends and family and curbs news posts</a>.

In terms of "tech product years" this was *light-years* ago. Facebook's feed has evolved over the past 5 years and I'm sure it's much more parametrizable. I haven't used it since about 2018.

But even if that's true, Facebook and other social algorithmic feeds operate under the ultimate directive: keep your attention and maximize time spent on the platform. 

<b>Any one algorithm that is optimized for the purpose of attention retention inevitably forces its subjects into informational biases.</b>

<h2>Algorithmic Feeds Hinder Our Perception Of The World</h2>

Mainstream algorithmic feeds are inappropriate when it comes to building a more comprehensive – balanced – view of the world. 

They are not build with that purpose in mind. The most common purpose of these feed algorithm is retention, engagement or both. The Facebook and Twitter like feeds will operate as follows:

1. *"show more of the stuff you interacted with" –* the logic of "if you liked X then take more X to stay with us", in the hopes of keeping you on the platform for longer times;
2. *"show the top voted/discussed (controversial) thing"* – the logic of "a lot of people like this so maybe so will you", in the hopes of getting your attention, engage and retain you on the platform;

Either one of those forces a conditioned view of the world.

1. Pretty straightforward: you see more of the same, so your views get reinforced and there's very few dissent from whichever is your dominating view. The classic filter bubble.
2. You see what's "trending" according to the platform's notion of trending. It may or not be in line with your current view of the world and depends on the platform's ideology/stance. It can be a sort of "mob mentality" approach. It can also be weaponized. For instance, Twitter bots artificially amplifying narratives.

Marcus Aurelius said "The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts." I'd extend this thought and say "what you feed your mind shapes your interpretation of reality."
