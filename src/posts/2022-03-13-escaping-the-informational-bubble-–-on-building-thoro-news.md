title: Escaping the Informational Bubble – on Building Thoro News
summary: As [](https://thoro.news)<a href="https://thoro.news"
  target="_blank">Thoro News</a> reaches almost 10MM articles in its database
  and 2MM clustered topics, I take the time to reflect on the *raison d'être* of
  this personal project that started in 2019.

I'm a strong believer that the best way to generate a more accurate view of the world is by feeding our minds with a broad and diverse set of information. Truth will lie somewhere in the middle.

We don't control the mental mechanism that shapes our opinions, thoughts and beliefs but we can determine which information we feed our minds.

<h2>News feeds from others</h2>

It all started around 2017 when I optimized my Facebook news feed to only display posts from news pages. I was following perhaps less than 50 news sources and, for a while, it was ok.

The first problem I noticed was that I was only seeing a subset of news published by the page. If I entered the page, I'd see there were many more posts published on any given day, but Facebook's algorithm had decided that only a couple of posts would get put on my wall. So essentially I had no control over which posts were being shown as well as no understanding to why one post was shown over the other.

The second problem was that, at any point, Facebook could and would change the way its algorithmic feed operated. In 2018, Facebook <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/01/11/facebook-focuses-news-feed-on-friends-and-family-curbing-the-reach-of-brands-and-media/" target="_blank">decided it would prioritize posts mad by friends and family and curbs news posts</a>.

Note that in terms of "tech product years" this was *light-years* ago. Facebook's feed has evolved over the past 5 years and I'm sure it's much more parametrizable. I haven't used it since about 2018.

But even if it is more customizable, Facebook and other algorithmic feeds suffer from the ultimate 



My greatest cognitive fear is to not know about the things I do not know.

Marcus Aurelius said "The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts." I'd extend this thought and say "what you feed your mind shapes your interpretation of reality."
