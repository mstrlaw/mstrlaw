I’m lucky to have both a background in engineering but also in marketing & management. These areas complement each other wonderfully, although sometimes it can be tough to strike the right balance between both when building products.

## Delivery Starts on Discovery

This is, to me, the most fundamental notion that can impact the success of a product.
If you’re any sort of product owner — founder, CEO, product manager — you’ll get the best bang for your buck by involving engineers as early as possible in the discovery stage.

“If you’re just using your engineers to code, you’re only getting about half their value.”
— Marty Cagan, Inspired

Of course the quality of the feedback you get will depend on the seniority and specialization of the engineers you talk to but it also depends on their overall business savviness. In essence, you want someone that can do a balanced, comprehensive analysis of the problem to be solved.

To simplify we can look at two axises: technical knowledge and business knowledge.
