A conversation on the (Views on Vue)[https://viewsonvue.com/building-micro-frontends-with-lawrence-almeida-vue-160] podcast with (Lindsay Wardell)[https://www.lindsaykwardell.com/] where we discussed basic issues with micro frontends, and how they can be
resolved with Single SPA, a framework for orchestrating micro frontends.
