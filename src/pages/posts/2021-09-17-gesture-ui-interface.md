[Proof of concept](https://gitlab.com/mstrlaw/kiosk) for a gesture based web interface.
The idea is to have a way to control a computer screen without having to touch it or without direct physicall access to it (ex: placed behind a shop's window). It could be used to interact with some form of product display kiosk or even some form of interactive game for passerby.

Play with it on [keeosk.netlify.app](https://keeosk.netlify.app) (requires browser camera access, no everything runs locally)
